# Hearthfire Social Kitchen & Bar – Recommendations

This document turns the analysis into specific, actionable recommendations.  
It is structured in three horizons:

- **0–30 days:** Quick wins and immediate fixes  
- **30–60 days:** Targeted experiments and tuning  
- **60–90 days:** Structural and strategic changes

Where relevant, suggested metrics to monitor are included.

---

## 1. 0–30 Days – Quick Wins

### 1.1 Tighten Saturday & Sunday prep

**Action**

- Reduce default prep volumes for **short-shelf-life items** (especially halibut and other seafood specials).
- Shift some prep work from **Saturday morning to later Saturday** based on real-time demand.

**Why**

- Waste costs spike on Saturday/Sunday without a matching increase in sales.
- Short shelf life + aggressive prep = guaranteed margin erosion.

**Metrics to watch**

- Waste cost ($) on Sat/Sun  
- Sell-through rate on seafood specials  
- Weekend margin % vs weekday margin %

---

### 1.2 Enforce clock-in / clock-out discipline

**Action**

- Cap early clock-ins without manager approval (e.g., more than 5 minutes early).  
- Review weekly timecard reports for **systematic early/late trends**, especially on Sunday.

**Why**

- Sunday labor % is too high for the revenue it generates.
- Small time leaks across multiple shifts compound quickly.

**Metrics**

- Labor % by day  
- Variance between scheduled vs actual labor hours

---

### 1.3 Adjust Sunday Late Night operations

**Action**

- Either:  
  - Shorten Sunday Late Night hours, **or**  
  - Convert it into a minimal-service period (bar only, limited menu).

**Why**

- Late Night sales on Sunday are too low to justify current staffing and prep levels.

**Metrics**

- Sunday Late Night sales vs labor cost  
- Net contribution margin for the daypart

---

## 2. 30–60 Days – Targeted Experiments

### 2.1 Redesign bar + food pairings

**Action**

- Build **intentional pairings** that combine:
  - High-margin cocktails or NA drinks  
  - Medium-margin entrées or apps  
- Example:  
  - “Hearthfire Burger + Signature Old Fashioned”  
  - “Citrus Cooler + Smash Burger” value combo for non-drinkers

**Why**

- Bar categories drive profitability; pairings help protect margin even when entrées are less efficient.
- Encourages a higher **check average** without deep discounting.

**Metrics**

- Attachment rate of featured drinks to entrées (how often they’re sold together)  
- Average check size for guests ordering promo bundles  
- Category mix shift toward cocktails / NA beverages

---

### 2.2 Tune menu engineering around underperforming dishes

**Action**

- Review contribution margin and popularity for:
  - Halibut special  
  - Short rib gnocchi  
- Options:
  - Slight **price adjustments**,  
  - Portion/cost tweaks, or  
  - Limiting availability to specific days (e.g., only Fri/Sat) to control waste.

**Why**

- These dishes risk becoming “margin sinkholes” if left unchecked.
- Scarcity can make specials feel more attractive while controlling cost.

**Metrics**

- Margin % by entrée  
- Frequency of 86’ing specials early vs wasting them  
- Guest feedback on perceived value

---

### 2.3 Strengthen Tuesday Dinner & Thursday Late Night

**Action**

- **Tuesday Dinner:**  
  - Promote a value-focused pairing (e.g., burger + beverage combo) to convert strong Happy Hour traffic into dinner revenue.
- **Thursday Late Night:**  
  - Introduce a targeted promo (industry night, classic cocktail night, or small plates special) backed by high-margin drinks.

**Why**

- Tuesday Dinner underperforms relative to Happy Hour volume.  
- Thursday Late Night has the potential to become a strong “pre-weekend” anchor.

**Metrics**

- Tuesday and Thursday sales vs baseline  
- Covers by daypart  
- Mix of high-margin items sold during promos

---

## 3. 60–90 Days – Structural Improvements

### 3.1 Formalize a weekly “prep and waste review”

**Action**

- End-of-week huddle between chef, bar lead, and GM to review:
  - Waste by category and item  
  - Prep levels vs actual sales  
  - Specials that over- or under-performed

**Why**

- Makes waste a **visible, shared metric**, not just a back-of-house issue.
- Encourages iterative tuning rather than one-time fixes.

**Metrics**

- Week-over-week waste trend  
- Number of menu/prep adjustments logged from these meetings  
- Overall weekly margin %

---

### 3.2 Build a simple internal KPI dashboard

*(This ties directly to the data & visuals in this repository.)*

**Action**

- Create a small dashboard (Power BI, Excel, or Python notebook) that tracks:
  - Daily sales, covers, and margin  
  - Labor % by day  
  - Waste cost by day  
  - Category mix (bar vs food, etc.)

**Why**

- Gives leadership a **single source of truth** for performance.  
- Forms the basis for future forecasting or scenario modeling.

**Metrics**

- Adoption: How often is the dashboard used in decision-making meetings?  
- Speed: How quickly can weekly performance questions be answered?

---

### 3.3 Staffing & training model for the bar

**Action**

- Ensure that on all **high-volume nights** (Thu–Sat):
  - At least one experienced bartender is paired with newer staff.
  - New bar hires receive structured training on both **speed and upselling**.

**Why**

- The bar is the margin engine; throughput and suggestive selling matter.
- Protects against nights where strong sales potential is lost to slower service.

**Metrics**

- Bar sales by day & hour  
- Cocktail/NA beverage attachment rate to entrées  
- Guest feedback / wait time for drinks (if available)

## 4. How This Demonstrates Analytics Skills

From an analyst portfolio perspective, this project highlights:

- **Data hygiene & structure** – Clear separation of raw vs processed data.  
- **Analytical reasoning** – Connecting category/item performance, labor, and waste into a cohesive business story.  
- **Communication** – Executive summary, detailed findings, and actionable recommendations written in stakeholder-friendly language.  
- **Visualization** – Focused charts that support specific business questions, not just “pretty graphs”.

These materials are designed so that a hiring manager or stakeholder can quickly see both the **technical thinking** and the **business value** behind the analysis.
