# Hearthfire Social Kitchen + Bar — Business Analytics Case Study  
*A fictional restaurant scenario developed to demonstrate business analytics, data interpretation, and operational decision-making.*

---

## 📌 Project Overview  
This project is a complete business analytics case study built around **Hearthfire Social Kitchen + Bar**, a fictional chef-driven restaurant. The goal is to demonstrate how a data analyst interprets operational data (sales, margin, labor, waste, and dayparts) and translates it into clear insights and actionable recommendations for leadership.

The analysis includes:

- Sales and margin interpretation  
- Menu mix & pricing insights  
- Bar program optimization  
- Labor alignment analysis  
- Waste & prep evaluation  
- Daypart performance review  
- Multi-step diagnostic problem solving  
- Executive-level strategic guidance  

This case study represents **end-to-end analytical thinking** without relying on complex tooling — focusing instead on how an analyst identifies patterns, tells the story behind the numbers, and proposes high-impact operational improvements.

## 🎯 Project Goals  
- Demonstrate structured analytical thinking  
- Show real-world business problem solving  
- Interpret multi-factor restaurant performance data  
- Build a portfolio-ready business case study  
- Present findings in an executive-friendly format  
- Practice diagnostic reasoning used in analytics interviews

## 📚 Context  
Restaurants operate on extremely thin margins. This project simulates the real-world complexity of interpreting performance data where:

- Sales don’t always equal profit  
- High volume can hide inefficiencies  
- Menu mix affects both margin and labor  
- Waste ripple effects spread across days  
- Staff experience impacts revenue velocity  
- Specials can either elevate or harm margin depending on execution  

This case study demonstrates how an analyst identifies these patterns and turns them into clear, impactful operational decisions.

---

## 🚀 Future Enhancements  
- Add mock sales, labor, and waste datasets  
- Build Python notebooks for analysis  
- Create SQL queries to validate assumptions  
- Develop Power BI dashboards  
- Add scenario simulations (e.g., margin impact of new specials)
