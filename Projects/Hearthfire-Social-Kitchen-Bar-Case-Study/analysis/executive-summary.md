# Executive Summary — Hearthfire Social Kitchen + Bar

Hearthfire Social Kitchen + Bar completed a full diagnostic review of sales, labor efficiency, daypart performance, and margin health using one full operational week of data. The analysis revealed a business with strong demand patterns, clear category strengths, and several operational inefficiencies that, once corrected, will materially improve profitability.

## Key Week Highlights
- **Total weekly revenue:** $31,870  
- **Best performing day:** **Friday** — strongest bar performance and highest margin (75.3%).  
- **Weakest performing day:** **Sunday** — low sales, high labor %, high waste.  
- **Strongest daypart:** **Dinner**, responsible for most sales volume and margin contribution.  
- **Highest margin category:** **Cocktails**, averaging ~75% margin.  
- **Most problematic category:** Entrées featuring **seafood and labor-heavy dishes**.

## High-Level Insights
1. **Bar performance is the single greatest driver of weekly margin**  
   Friday’s margin leadership is directly tied to bar revenue dominance. Conversely, slower bar service or poorly constructed bar–food pairings directly suppress weekly margin.

2. **Entrées have margin imbalance and over-prep issues**  
   The halibut special and braised short rib gnocchi significantly underperform relative to category peers.

3. **Waste spikes on Sat–Sun align with over-prep and prep timing**  
   Saturday over-prep creates downstream waste on Sunday, where sales soften.

4. **Labor inefficiency trends align with predictable daypart patterns**  
   Sunday’s labor % ballooned to 41.9% due to low late-night traffic and misaligned staffing.

## Strategic Opportunity
If Hearthfire:
- optimizes bar staffing operations,
- corrects Saturday prep timing,
- tightens entrée cost performance, and
- strengthens late-night and Tuesday dinner dayparts,

the business can **increase weekly margin by 3–5 percentage points**, translating to **$900–$1,400 additional weekly profit**, or **$46k–$72k annually**.

Hearthfire is well-positioned to make rapid, high-ROI improvements with minimal structural changes.
