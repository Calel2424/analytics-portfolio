- Friday is the peak day with **$3,900 dinner revenue** and **138 covers**.

### Happy Hour is a surprise strength

### Late Night is underperforming
- LN traffic is **weak on Sunday (13 covers)** and **low all week except Thu–Fri**.

## 3. Labor Efficiency

### Major findings
- **Sunday labor % = 41.9%**, highest of week.
- BOH staffing is too heavy relative to demand on Sat–Sun.
- FOH staffing is relatively efficient but suffers on slow late-night services.

## 4. Waste Patterns

### Waste correlates strongly with over-prep behavior
- Waste spikes:
  - **Saturday:** $143  
  - **Sunday:** $75  
- Both connect to **over-prep of halibut** and other short-life ingredients.

### Entrées are contributing disproportionately to waste

## 5. Category Sales Mix

### Highest Margin Categories
- **Cocktails:** ~75% margin  
- **Desserts:** highly efficient (75%+) but underpromoted  
- **N/A Beverages:** extremely efficient (88.8%) and important for low-spend guests

### Troubled Items

- **Seasonal Halibut:** highest spoilage risk + lowest entrée margin

## 6. Operational Behavior Indicators

### Tuesday Dinner Weakness
- Despite good HH traffic, guests trade down to specials.
- Lower bar attachment rate depresses sales and margin.

### Thursday Service Bottleneck
- Two inexperienced bartenders reduced rounds per guest.
- Wine pairing promo diluted margins further.

### Saturday Prep Timing
- Prep is clustered early, causing:
  - Overproduction  
  - Waste  
  - Higher labor hours  

### Sunday Operations
- Sunday behaves like a “false busy” day:
  - Strong early sales
  - Rapid falloff after dinner
  - Labor never adjusted downward
